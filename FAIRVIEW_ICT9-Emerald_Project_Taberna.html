			<td><img class="img-thumbnail bg-secondary" src="flame.jpeg" height="300px" width="400px"><br>Inspect Your Heating Sources</td>
			<td>House fires may very well be triggered if your home heating sources are not working properly. Be sure to always clean out your air conditioning filters, keep your heaters away from anything that is flammable, and have these things checked out by a professional once a year.</td>

			<td><img class="img-thumbnail bg-secondary" src="charge.png" height="300px" width="400px"><br>Maintain Your Wires</td>
			<td>Before you plug something into a socket, try to be courteous in ensuring that the wire hasn’t been torn or chewed up (in case you have any pets running around). Damaged wires can be a detrimental fire hazard and need replacing as soon as possible. Also, remember that wires do get hot when in use, so be sure to check your wire placement and avoiding passing them under a carpet or anywhere that could potentially catch fire.</td>

		<tr class="table-secondary">
			<td><img class="img-thumbnail bg-secondary" src="ex.jpeg" height="300px" width="400px"><br>Keep Fire Extinguishers Around At All Times</td>
			<td>Fire extinguishers and blankets will be your best defence in the event of a fire breaking out. Every family member should know how to use a fire extinguisher, so in case something in your home does catch fire, it can be put out as fast as possible. Fire blankets are also very useful for putting out small fires before they become something larger and fiercer.
There is nothing more devastating than losing all your belongings to a house fire. After all, your home is likely to be the source of many beautiful memories, and you owe it to yourself to protect it.</td>
